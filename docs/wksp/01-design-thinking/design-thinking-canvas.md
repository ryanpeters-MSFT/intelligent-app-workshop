# Design Thinking Canvas

In this module, we will leverage the Design Thinking Canvas to identify customer needs and pain points, and explore how AI-driven solutions can address them effectively. This will also ensure that the workshop is more relevant as we get more hands-on in the coming hours and days.

!!! Tip
