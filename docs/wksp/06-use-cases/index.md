# Deep-Dive into AI Use-Cases 

In this module, we will undertake a comprehensive exploration of [Project Miyagi](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/miyagi) and the [Reddog](https://github.com/Azure/reddog-solutions) codebase. This deep dive will highlight a range of use-cases that can be adopted into your own applications, thereby enabling you to infuse AI to address the diverse needs of your end users.
